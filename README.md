#  Play With Emojis

Beginner friendly SwiftUI project (built for iOS only as of now) to understand and experiment with SwiftUI. It contains the following features as of now

- Creating new emojis by supplying the name and the emoji.
- Listing the existing emojis. However, there is no mechanism to persist data as of now. Only the 4 emojis pre-populated in code are to be found during startup.
- Animation of all the emojis with the help of offsets and rotation.
